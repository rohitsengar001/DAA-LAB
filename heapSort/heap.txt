Binary Heap :
--------------------------------
A complete binary tree is a binary tree  in which every level except the last,is completely filled,and all nodes are as far 
left as possible.A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree where items are stored in a special order such that value in a parent 
node is greater(or smaller) than the values in its two children nodes. The former is called as max heap and the latter is 
called min-heap. The heap can be represented by a binary tree or array.


Heap Sort Algorithm for sorting in increasing order:
------------------------------------------------------
1. Build a max heap from the input data.
2. At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed
 by reducing the size of heap by 1. Finally, heapify the root of the tree.
3. Repeat step 2 while size of heap is greater than 1.


Algorithm :

 HEAPSORT(A)
1 BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A)
2 for i ←length[A] downto 2
3   do exchange A[1] ↔ A[i]
4   heap-size[A] ←heap-size[A]−1
5   MAX-HEAPIFY(A,1)

 MAX-HEAPIFY(A,i)
1 l ← LEFT(i)
2 r ← RIGHT(i)
3 if l ≤heap-size[A] andA[l] > A[i]
4 then largest ←l
5 else largest ←i
6 if r ≤heap-size[A] andA[r] > A[largest]
7 then largest ←r
8 if largest =i  
9   then exchange A[i] ↔ A[largest]
10  MAX-HEAPIFY(A,largest)

 BUILD-MAX-HEAP(A)
1 heap-size[A] ←length[A]
2 for i ← length[A]/2 downto 1    
3     do MAX-HEAPIFY(A,i)
